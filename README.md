Refactor Challenge from Module 1 (HTML, GitHub, CSS)

Horiseon is a Social Solutions Company that offers services such as social media marketing, search engine optimization,
and online reputation management. Their website explains the importance and benefits of maintaining your company's social media 
marketing.

Horiseon provided me with the oportunity to refactor their webpage, in order to improve accessability and search engine
optimization. I was even able to clean up some of the CSS properties and HTML elements to ensure long-term stability for
Horiseon's website.

## Cleaning Up the HTML / Functionality

The screenshot above shows the addition of a consice title to the Horiseon webpage. Any webpage should have a title for optimum usability
and SEO.

The first div element contains the header and the navigation links. The "search-engine-optimization" link was not functioning, but by
adding the id "search-engine-optimization" to line 35 i was able to make the link function properly, and navigate
to the correct part of the webpage (see below)

You can see the added id element here. To meet accessibility standards, I also added alt attributes to each of the images on this
section of the webpage, with consice but detailed descriptions. Each <div> within the <div class="content"> was also
given a class of "section" instead of individual id's, in order to improve stylesheet efficiency.
